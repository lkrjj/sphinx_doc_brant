Threshold Estimation
--------------------------------
    
*find out for each subject, the sparsity under each threshold of correlation*
    
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **data dir**: directory where all *.txt correlation matrix results are stored.
* **use absolute value of input matrics**: as it means
    
* **intensity threshold**: vector of thresholds for matrix intensity. e.g. correlation coefficient
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
- **Buttons**:
    - **S**: Save parameters of the current panel to a *.mat file. The *.mat can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    - **L**: Load parameters from *.mat for the current panel.

Network Calculation
-----------------------------
    
* **parallel workers**: number of workers used for parallel computing.
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **data dir**: directory where all *.txt correlation matrix results are stored.
    
* **matrix type**:
    * **raw value**: use raw value to construct binary matrix.
    * **absolute value**: use absolute value to construct binary matrix.
	
* **intensity threshold**: vector of thresholds for matrix intensity. e.g. correlation coefficient
* **thresholds of sparsity**: a vector of sparsity threshold, for each element, threshold the input matrix using the fraction of the matrix¡¯s largest number of connection n * (n+1)/2;
    
* **minimum spanning tree**: a process to avoid unconnected network. To label the backbone of the network's nodes.
    
* **matrix type**: binarized and weighted network. The binarized networks comes from thresholded input matrics, while the weighted network comes from a dot product operation of binarized network and the original network.
* **Network properies**: a panel to select network properties.
    in the option panel, (*) means the calculation of the property is slow.
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
* **zero value in clustering coefficient**: if the network is connected in a way (e.g. Hamilton path) that neighbour nodes are not connected; or the current node has only one neighbour node.
* **Inf in small worldness**: The small-worldness is calculated as real-network / random-network, and in real and random case, small-worldness is calculated as clustering coefficient/shortest-path length. If the mean clustering coefficient of the random-network is zero, then the small-worldness of random-network is zero, and it will cause the real-network / random-network to be Inf(any non-zero divided by 0). The solution is set smaller thresholds that avaliable for all subjects.

Network Statistics
----------------------------
    
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **data dir**: directory where *.mat result of NETWORK CALCULATION is stored.
* **stat type**: one sample t-test, two sample t-test and paired t-test.
* **groups**:
    * for two sample t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do two-sample t-test for SZ and NC
    * for paired t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do paired t-test for SZ and NC
    * for one sample t-test, e.g. SZ;NC -> will do one-sample t-test for both SZ and NC group
    
* **grouping info**:
    * **table**: A comma-seperated values (csv) table, which is used for parsing subject names and covariates. The parsed names/ids will be matched to search results conducted with datadir and filetype. Before matching, BRANT will remove specified strings.
	
    * For one and two sample t-tests:
       ====== ======== ========== =======
       name   group    filter     age
       ====== ======== ========== =======
       subj1  SZ       center1    28
       subj2  SZ       center1    27
       subj3  NC       center1    30
       subj4  NC       center2    25
       ====== ======== ========== =======
	
    * For paired t-test, another column of paired_t_idx is required to specify paired subjects in each group:
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
       name   group    filter     age     paired_t_idx
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
       subj1  stage1   center1    28      1
       subj2  stage1   center1    27      2
       subj3  stage2   center1    30      1
       subj4  stage2   center2    25      2
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
        
* **string removal***: optional. remove partial string from string parsed by id index.
* **regressors***: optional. title of regressors which will be regressed out before statistical analysis. e.g. age
* **filter***: optional. use the control for subject in different state or center, fill in center1 here and subject4 won't be included in the analysis.
* **discard subjects without info**: when checked, if subjects' information are not found in the table, a warning message will be shown; when unchecked, an error message will be shown.    
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
* If the output figure is empty, check whether there is NaN or Inf in the output *.csv files, where the raw global network properties are extracted.
